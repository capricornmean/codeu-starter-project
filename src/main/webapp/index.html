      Hello my name is Mai. (how you call my name is exactly like Mike without the K :D (or my) )<br>
      I'm currently a first-year student at University of Engineering and Technology, VNU (so I started this quite early, yeah?)<br>
      I'm ready to challenge myself so I decided to take part in this project (probably because I have a lot of free time too)<br> <br>
